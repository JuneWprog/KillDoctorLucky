### About/Overview

The world of our project consists of a number of non-overlapping spaces that are laid out on a 2D grid. The details of the world is specified in a simple text file that consists of three sections:

1. world description including the size, the name, the target character, and the target character's pet.
2. a detailed list of all of the spaces or rooms that make up the world
3. a detailed list of all of the items that can be found in the world

The program as specified in the problem description reads the details of the world from a text file and creates a model corresponding to that. The program uses the Readable interface to read the world specification and hence can read data from multiple sources like file or a string. The program internally uses a Map representation to model the layout of the World. Using Map makes the operations like getting neighbours extremely fast. Lastly, the program outputs the World in the form of an Image of the World layout. The image is provided in the form of BufferedImage.

This game has two types of players: Human and Computer Players. Each player should be identified by their name. They enter the world in a space of their choice. With multiple players, each player gets a turn in the order in which they were added to the game. The options for actions that player can take in a single turn are:

1. Moving to a neighboring space.
2. Picking up an item from the space they are currently occupying.
3. Look around the space they are currently occupying.
4. Moving Target Pet to a space.
5. Attempt to kill a Target using the Items they have.

### List of Features

The program provides the following features:

1. Display information about a specified space on the view.
2. Create a graphical representation of the world map and provide the ability to save the graphical representation to a file as a PNG file.
3. Allow users to restart game or start game with new game settings.
4. Add a human-controlled player to the game.
5. Add a computer-controlled player to the game.
6. Allow a player to Move. This represents a turn.
7. Allow a player to pick up an item. This represents a turn.
8. Allow a player to look around. This represents a turn.
9. Allow a player to move Target's pet to a different space. This represents a turn.
10. Allow a player to make an attempt to kill Target. This represents a turn.
11. Display a description of a specific player.
12. Game ends when:
        - the maximum number of turns is reached in which case the target character escapes and runs away to live another day and nobody wins.
        - a player successfully kills the target character in which case they win the game.
13. Automatically move the Target character around the world after every turn.
14. Automatically move the Target character's pet around the world after every turn using Depth First Search.
